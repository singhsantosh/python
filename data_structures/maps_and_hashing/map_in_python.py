Time to play with Python dictionaries!

Work on a dictionary that stores cities by country and continent.
First - the city of Mountain View is in the USA, which is in North America.

Add the cities listed below by modifying the structure. Then, print out the values specified by looking them up
in the structure.

Cities to add: Bangalore (India, Asia) Atlanta (USA, North America) Cairo (Egypt, Africa) Shanghai (China, Asia)

locations = {'North America': {'USA': ['Mountain View']}}

Print the following (using "print").

A list of all cities in the USA in alphabetic order.
All cities in Asia, in alphabetic order, next to the name of the country. In your output, label each answer with a number so it looks like this:
1
American City
American City
2
Asian City - Country
Asian City - Country
